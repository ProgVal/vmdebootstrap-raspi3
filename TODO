TODO
====

* document the problems of setting a default password

* first-boot customisation support (via a package) which forces a
    new password, possibly new hostname, generate new ssh key etc.

* make all internal additions and operations optional

* investigate some way to support complex partitioning

* document that no-kernel can lead to images where the kernel
    cannot be upgraded.

* try to support upgrading the bootloader
    possibly via the config output
    problems of flash-kernel

* automatically grow rootfs to media size on first boot
    boot into ramdisk, umount media, move ext4 along media
    expand vfat.

* document of how to add new bootloader etc.
    unless the old and new bootloader exist as packages, this
    is going to be manual.

* customisations as packages.

* document how the image was built with the config called.
    include the config output and a copy of the script with
    dependencies.

* consider limitations of only one hook script
    likely to be a lack of time to implement multi-hook support.

* support method to share shell customisation scripts
