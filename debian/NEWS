vmdebootstrap (1.6-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * extlinux support is now deprecated. Grub to become default.

   extlinux relies on external components to install the bootloader
   inside the image which prevents vmdebootstap building the same image
   on different systems. For this reason, extlinux is deprecated and
   the default will change in a future release to disabling extlinux
   and using grub by default.
