# Fast option check tests

* A scenario, or set of scenarios, that verify that certain
  combinations of vmdebootstrap options work or fail as expected, but
  without actually building images. The goal is to test command line
  handling quickly. For example, options that conflict should cause
  error messages.
    * FIXME: Check with Neil for suggestions for options.
