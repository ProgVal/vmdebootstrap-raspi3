# Fast option check tests

This chapter contains fast scenarios that test vmdebootstrap option
handling. These scenarios do not actually build images, they only
verify that vmdebootstrap parses the command line correctly.

    SCENARIO --squash and --image used together
    ASSUMING fast tests are requested
    WHEN user attempts to run vmdebootstrap
    ... --squash=FOO --image=BAR --dry-run

    SCENARIO --image used with a zero size
    ASSUMING fast tests are requested
    WHEN user attempts to run vmdebootstrap
