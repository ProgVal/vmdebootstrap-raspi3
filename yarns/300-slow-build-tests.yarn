# Slow image building tests

In this chapter, we have test scenarios that actually build an image
and test the output. The images are not booted, but that may be added
later. Instead, all the tests on the images are static.

These tests are slow, since building images is slow.


## Build a very basic Debian 8 image

    SCENARIO build a basic Debian 8 image
    ASSUMING build tests are requested
    GIVEN user wants to build an image FOO.img that is 2GiB in size
    WHEN the user runs vmdebootstrap --sparse --extlinux
    THEN the image has the correct size
    AND the partition count of the image is 1
    AND partition 1 has the boot flag set
    AND partition 1 has an ext4 filesystem
    AND partition 1 has file /etc/debian_version matching ^8\..*$

    SCENARIO build a Debian 8 image with grub
    ASSUMING build tests are requested
    GIVEN user wants to build an image FOO.img that is 2GiB in size
    WHEN the user runs vmdebootstrap --grub
    THEN the image has the correct size
    AND the partition count of the image is 1
    AND partition 1 has the boot flag set
    AND partition 1 has an ext4 filesystem
    AND partition 1 has file /boot/grub/grub.cfg matching ^### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/00_header ###$
    AND partition 1 has file /etc/fstab matching ^\S+\s+\/\s+ext4\s+errors=remount-ro\s+\d\s+\d$

    SCENARIO build a Debian 8 image with uefi
    ASSUMING build tests are requested
    GIVEN user wants to build an image FOO.img that is 2GiB in size
    WHEN the user runs vmdebootstrap --grub --use-uefi
    THEN the image has the correct size
    AND the partition count of the image is 2
    AND partition 1 has an vfat filesystem
    AND partition 2 has file /boot/grub/grub.cfg matching ^### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/00_header ###$

    SCENARIO build a Debian 8 image with btrfs and grub
    ASSUMING build tests are requested
    GIVEN user wants to build an image FOO.img that is 2GiB in size
    WHEN the user runs vmdebootstrap --roottype=btrfs --grub
    THEN the image has the correct size
    AND the partition count of the image is 1
    AND partition 1 has the boot flag set
    AND partition 1 has an btrfs filesystem
    AND partition 1 has file /etc/fstab matching ^\S+\s+\/\s+btrfs\s+defaults\s+\d\s+\d$

    SCENARIO build a Debian 8 image with separate boot partition
    ASSUMING build tests are requested
    GIVEN user wants to build an image FOO.img that is 2GiB in size
    WHEN the user runs vmdebootstrap --bootsize=128M --boottype=ext3 --grub
    THEN the image has the correct size
    AND the partition count of the image is 2
    AND partition 1 has the boot flag set
    AND partition 1 has an ext3 filesystem
    AND partition 2 has an ext4 filesystem
    AND partition 2 has file /etc/fstab matching ^\S+\s+\/\s+ext4\s+errors=remount-ro\s+\d\s+\d$
    AND partition 2 has file /etc/fstab matching ^\S+\s+\/boot\s+ext3\s+errors=remount-ro\s+\d\s+\d$
